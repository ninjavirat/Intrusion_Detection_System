\chapter{Future Work}

In future we will use physical devices to do this experiment and will try to detect intrusion and malicious activity in real time by using blockchain technology. In which we will use geolocation of the attacker or ipaddress from where it is coming. After detecting the unwanted activity we will prevent that by designing IPS(intrusion prevention system) using cryptography and keep our data safe.
All the above work will be done by machine learning and cryptography. machine learning will be used to find the pattern or compare the coming attack with previous stored attacks.
