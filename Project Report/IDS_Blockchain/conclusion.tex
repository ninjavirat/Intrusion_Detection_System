From this project we have learned so many things related to blockchain and security and we came across python and R language . and we used there concept for detecting purpose . this is small without using any server and protocols . how the attack is happening in real life . but we can understand by this project how data can be changed and how can we detect our huge amount(big ) data files which is stored in somewhere (on server ) so there is easy to get the data and access and misused the data by intruder and attacker . so , here we use a new technology blockchain for detecting / checking purpose .(because if any person will try to change our data then it will be detected easily by blockchain (hash key will be alterd ).And intruder alarm will trun on automatically.
