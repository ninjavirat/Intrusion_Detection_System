I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to my professors Dr. SK Hafizul Islam. who gave me the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project on the topic Intrusion Detection Using Blockchain Technology, which also helped me in doing a lot of research and I came to know about so many new things such as Blockchain , Cryptography , Python-Django etc. I am really thankful to him.
Secondly I would also like to thank my parents and friends who helped me a lot in finalizing this project within the limited time frame. \\
