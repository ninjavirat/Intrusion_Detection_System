\chapter{Problem Definition}

Finding the malicious activity by using machine learning algorithm which uses pre stored information about attacks (signature based) .After that blockchain technique is used to detect whether data has been altered or not(on the basis of hash key) . unethical or unwanted activity change the information or data which is contained in particular block . then hash key of that block will change. Now we can compare previous hash key and current hash key of the block .if both are different then attack has happened.
